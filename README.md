## Usage

To get rates for a cart/order. simply use the plugin's template variable function.

Example:

```twig
{% set rates = craft.flatworld.getRates(cart.id) %}
```

The rates are returned as an array. Generally, this will return either:

1.  An empty array if the order is not found or has no line items.
2.  An array of 2 rates, with the first being the cheapest and the second being the fastest.
3.  An array of 1 rate if there is only 1 rate available, or if the cheapest and fastest rates are the same.

Example:

```
Array
  (
    [FLAT_RATE_SHIPPING] => Array
      (
        [arrival] => 3-7 days
        [transitTime] => 3
        [arrivalDateText] => 2023/10/23
        [amount] => 8
        [type] => parcel
      )

    [UPS_SECOND_DAY_AIR_AM] => Array
      (
        [arrival] => 1-3 days
        [transitTime] => 1
        [arrivalDateText] => 2023/10/19
        [amount] => 48.06
        [type] => parcel
      )
  )
```

Notes:

-   'type' will either be 'parcel' or 'ltl'.
